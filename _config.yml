  Hi, I’m Vladimir Eremin, I am a data scientist during the day and sometimes at night as well. Welcome to my blog, where I share stories hidden behind data. Here, I explore the realms of data science, quantitative finance, and problem-solving. This blog has started as my offline journal and and some point I decided to start publishing in the hope it may be helpful for others as well. Please look around if something catches your eye. Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions or suggestions.
  Additionally, for those of you in NYC, I co-host a data science meetup - if you’re around, I’ll be happy to meet you at our next event!
