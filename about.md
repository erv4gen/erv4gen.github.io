Hi, Iâ€™m Vladimir, a senior data scientist with a blend of quant finance and tech background.
Welcome to my blog, where I share stories hidden behind data. Here, I explore the realms of data science, quantitative finance, and problem-solving.
This blog has started as my offline journal and at some point I decided to start publishing it in the hope it may be helpful for others as well.
Please look around if something catches your eye. Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions or suggestions.

Additionally, for those of you in NYC, I co-host a data science meetup - if you're around, I'll be happy to meet you at our next event!
