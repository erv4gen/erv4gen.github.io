<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
All heard about the arrest of our minister of a mine? I hope that all. And so, all this sensation is partially connected with the future (possible) transaction on privatization. Of course, privatization at all not that term which is suitable for this situation. And situation very simple: the Rosneft Oil Company is going to redeem the Bashneft company. Upon we have that one STATE company acquires other STATE company. Where here privatization, I think this question only Dasha pathfinder will be able to answer. But it is not even so important. My idea is in participating in this transaction. Namely to carry out small arbitration on the deal about the purchase. According to the latest data, Rosneft exposed the offer at a price 3700, and it on 200rr above, then the current market price. Having redeemed shares from the market and having sold them according to the offer to the issuer it is possible to take away just these 200r that about 6% of profitability. Let's look what from this will leave. Thus it is necessary to consider that the repayment price still is definitely not confirmed, and there are risks of changes or in general refusal from the transaction. For this reason apparently, participants of the market even did not drive quotation into the repayment prices. As it is my first transaction on absorption, volume I take extremely low.
