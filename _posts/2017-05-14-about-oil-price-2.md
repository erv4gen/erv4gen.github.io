Alas, until recently there was at all no opportunity to be engaged in independent researchers. Now it became slightly simpler with it, and it means that I will shortly publish some practices.

 Plus still is an idea entirely to move to the independent website shortly.
Amicably, it would be necessary to give some comment on the global markets from the equipment or macroeconomic, especially against the background of the arriving news.

It is remarkable that the other day Google recorded a historical maximum by requests for World War III. News of this sort always pushes people to invest in the "protected" assets and commodity. On the one hand, it looks quite reasonable, at the conflicting demand for raw materials will increase. But there is one problem: historically the prices don't keep long at the high levels, and correction will take away finally all collected profit. I have shown to one client who has wanted to invest for a long time in oil I the following chart:

At the same time, the blue line &nbsp;price in nominal dollars, and the red line - in brought on inflation since 2011.</span></div>
