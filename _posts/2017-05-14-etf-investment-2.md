It is known that any investor respecting himself puts the main objective ensuring profitability on the invested capital.<br />
Both intraday traders and strategic investors aspire to it.<br />
But how to define, an activity of the managing director is how productive? It is clear, that negative profitability is<br />
inefficiency indicator, but how indeed to estimate actual cost-effectiveness? Let's assume, the trader earned about 20% in a year,<br />
at a growth of index fund by only 15%. Whether it is worth investing in this managing director? Considering that a mean square deviation<br />
at the trader is higher than at the index (coefficients 0,1 and 0,05 are taken), it is possible to calculate Sharp's indicator for two portfolios: for the trader,it will turn out 1.2, for the index 1.4. And it means that the trader spending for work with the market till many hours a day in the long term<br />
will lose on profitability to the one who bought index fund.<br />
It, of course, rough approach, and I do not consider that active management has no chances to overtake the index. Moreover, is<br />
set of examples of how on an extent of decades funds showed the profitability advancing a benchmark by percent.<br />
The idea is that before trying to overtake the index, it is necessary at first to be able to show profitability, commensurable with it. In search of the answer<br />
on this question I came across material about how to operate risks in buy&amp;hold of strategy for index funds. Especially it was pleasant to me<br />
the idea with rebalancing of positions on volatility.<br />
Generally, here article if to whom it is interesting:<br />
