<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most recent lean in AI have started with ChatGPT in 2023, driven by its ability to generate human-like text and its quick adoption across industries for tasks like customer support, content creation, and programming assistance.It was the frontier of AI. In 2024, and I suppose in 2025 the key trend will be AI agent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI agent is mostly understood as the LLM wrapped in the engine that can execute commands, tasks, workflows and overall act autonomously. The AI industry betting that whoever can deliver the first agent that can reliably execute tasks autonomously, will capture the market. Industries such as technology, finance, and logistics are particularly keen on leveraging autonomous agents to streamline operations and innovate. the market is huge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Technology industry, and software engineering in particular are at the front line of agentic AI, since software engineering (SWE) is relatively "easy" to automate, since the SWE process is a closed-loop system that can be explicitly defined and provides the immediate feedback for the agent to steer their behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently took over the project that is required to maintain a relatively big codebase. Normally, you'd hire a SWE who will maintain and evolve the codebase. But since we just entered the 2025, why not try to 'hire' an AI for that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few key players who have already shipped their MVPs for SWE agents: Cognition AI with Devin, Cursor AI, and a host of open-sourced projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to explore one open-source framework—Open Hands AI (OH). The choice was made primarily because OH works out of the box, is quite stable, and is well-supported on GitHub.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Open Hands AI</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want to test how capable the AI agent is of maintaining the existing codebase, and if it works, I can slowly expand its capacity to more complex problems. Ideally, I want to have a designated AI SWE that will pick up issues in the git repo, resolve it, create a PR and make sure all pre-commit hooks are completed and tests are run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to go with Open Hands AI. This seems to be a well-funded and well-maintained project. Plus, it's quite easy to deploy and test and doesn't require much of maintenance. These are very important requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My first attempt was to use All Hands AI to fix Python code styling, using the format of Pep8 and Pylint. It would take me about 15 minutes to do, but the Open Hands did it in less than a minute. It was a promising start. Next, I assigned it to the task of migrating <code>yaml</code> files, and it did quite well. It made one error in the PR, so you should pay close attention to the code it generates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Open Hands AI as a Personal Assistant</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to step forward and use OpenHands as a personal assistant in planning tasks and leisure.<br>My workflow is defined as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>I have a GitHub project that I use to track my personal tasks</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>I create an issue in this project with a detailed description of the task</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>I order the Open Hands agent to read the issue, execute the task described there, write a document and provide a PR as a deliverable</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Monitor the execution.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9528,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="/media/2025/01/Pasted-image-20250105135027.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9528"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The agent successfully picked up the task:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9529,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/media/2025/01/Pasted-image-20250105135147-1024x607.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9529"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took them less than a minute to visit the <a href="https://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/">New York Theatre Guide</a> and pick up top three titles. This was a lazy execution.<br>Then, I've added a comment to explicitly spend considerable amount of time executing the task:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9530,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="/media/2025/01/Pasted-image-20250105135425.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9530"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And again, the OH agent had no problem verbalize what is required from him:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9531,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/media/2025/01/Pasted-image-20250105135543-1024x359.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9531"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nonetheless, the agent still spent at most 1 min on the task. Still not convincing him on how to spend more time in research.<br>Apparently, The agent lacks the sense of sufficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to proceed the old-good way of setting a timer and doesn't allow task to complete untill the time is up:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(sleep 300 &amp;&amp; echo "Timer done!") &amp;</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And again, the agent verbalized correctly what is required from them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9532,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/media/2025/01/Pasted-image-20250105141506-1024x148.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9532"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But yet again, they completed the task after another single search.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interesting, that this problem does not appear when the agent is tasked with the a coding problem. Since coding provided s firm feedback - the code is running or throws an error, which creates a natural feedback loop: the agent keep working until no more errors occur (or, they stuck in the infinite loop).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the agent tasked with an open-ended question without <em>clear hard evaluation</em>, it'll fall back to the simplest possible solution - take the first sufficient result and call it a day. Which is not quite different from how a human will approach an open-ended problem. To make it work, we must consider the open-ended research/lookup questions the same way as we consider the coding questions: by providing [[L-Checklist Manifesto|checklist]]!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first checklist is time, since time spent on task roughly translated to the amount of effort one put on executing the task.<br>Another checklist that I can think of, is providing a detailed log of material researched. If I ordered to visit at least 20 websites, I'd expect all 20 websites to be logged in the doc.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>```
# Content
## Description
This repo contains tasks and descriptions for the tasks.

- Tasks are defined in the GitHub `Issues.`
- A task can be considered as done only when a PR that is related to the GitHub `Issue` is merged
- A task must pass a checklist before the PR can be created
- A task consists of two sections:
  1. _Execution log_: markdown file `execution_log_&lt;task>.md`
  2. _Report_: : markdown file `report_&lt;task>.md`

## Read Tasks
The agent can fetch open tasks by using GitHub CLI commands.
> NOTE: The agent must install the GitHub CLI first since it's not installed by default.

The agent should supply the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable to the `gh` CLI to fetch open issues.

## Task Execution
The agent starts the task execution by printing the content and reflecting on the task description and checklist.
The agent must set up required prerequisites before starting the task (e.g., set up timer). Only after that, the agent can start task execution.

During the task execution, the agent documents their findings in the execution log during the execution stage. The agent searches the web, evaluates findings against task inputs, and logs data if it passes the criteria.
The agent must include sources for all inputs added to the execution log, including, but not limited to, the website, the reason this information was selected, etc. The goal of the execution log is to provide a detailed explanation of the reasoning process and how and why a given piece of information was selected. It must also contain enough metadata for the user to look it up and verify independently.

During the research stage, the agent should not sit idle (e.g., waiting for the timer to run up) unless input from the user is required. 
During the Report creation stage, the agent evaluates data in the execution log and compiles a report that directly addresses the task definition. 
The report has two sections: 
- `Results`: The actual deliverables compiled from the execution log
- `Checklist validation`: Explicit validation of the checklist.

Upon completing the report, the agent will use the GitHub CLI to create a PR and relate the PR to the original issue.


## Checklists 

### Timer
Timer checklist enforces that at least &lt;time> seconds are spent on the task. 
Before starting the task, one must set a timer for a given `&lt;time>`.
Use the following command to set up a timer for  `&lt;time>` seconds:


(sleep &lt;time> &amp;&amp; echo "Timer done!") &amp;

You can check `jobs` to see if the timer is still running.

### Metrics
The metrics checklist tracks the numerical quantities of the  _Execution log_: number of resources visited, diversity, etc.




## Example
Below is an example of a task description:

Issue #01: Task #01
Description:
Find out what the capital of the USA is.

Checklist:
- Timer: 1 min
- Metrics: must contain Wikipedia source 


When the agent is prompted to complete `Task #01`, the agent will use GitHub CLI to fetch task content.
It will check both the description and the checklist.
Since `Timer: 1 min` is required, the agent will call the command `(sleep 60 &amp;&amp; echo "Timer done!") &amp;` before starting the task.
Then, the agent will execute the task content and write to the `execution_log_01.md` during the execution.
The agent will not sit idle and wait until the timer runs up, it'll be occupied by the task all the time.
Before starting the report, the agent must check the checklist:
jobs

The command should not show a running timer;
`execution_log_01.md` file satisfies requirements from `Metrics.`
Only when all checklists are passed (marked &#91;x]) can the agent create the `report_01.md` file and then, based on this file, create the PR request.
The agent must relate the PR to the task issue.
The agent will create a PR with the following content:

&#91;PR Body]
PR: Task #01
Results:
According to wikipedia.org, the capital of the USA is Washington, D.C.

Checklist:
&#91;x] 1. Timer 1 min
&#91;x] 1. Metrics: Wikipedia is sourced 

**The PR will be related to the original issue**, which means that by merging the PR, the issue is closed, and the task is considered to be completed.


There will be at least two mandatory files in the PR:

&#91;execution_log_01.md]
Visited https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C
Found:
Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly known as Washington or D.C., is the capital city and federal district of the United States. The city is on the Potomac River, across from Virginia, and shares land borders with Maryland to its north and east. It was named after George Washington, the first president of the United States. The district is named after Columbia, the female personification of the nation.
This answers the question.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are inconsistency. It either forgot to add remaining shows to the execution log, or it just made up the list to meet the checklist requirements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interestingly, when I addressed this issue, the agent emmidietly agreed:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9535,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interesting part is that by admitting the flaw, it also discovered that the execution log does not meet the checklist requirement! This is the behavior that I expected and aimed for.<br>Looks like my idea with a checklist works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The agent finished the task with the following note:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>I've updated both the execution log and report to:

Include a complete initial shortlist of 10 shows with their theaters and starting prices
Show how I narrowed down to 5 shows for detailed analysis
Finally selected 3 shows for the final recommendation
The content is now consistent between both files and properly documents the research process. The checklist requirement of providing a shortlist of 10 plays has been properly met and documented. Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust?</code></pre>

<p>I hope this example showed how to set up an AI agent to conduct web search tasks and ensure it does what you meant. The critical piece is to add a detailed description of the task and enforce the agent to be as structured and as verbose as possible. So, next time you want to build your own AI assistant, be as explicit as possible. It is another example of how software engineering skills are very useful in building AI agents.<br>The next steps will be adding automatic checklists to ensure that the PR cannot be created until some checks are done and tuning the task description.</p>
