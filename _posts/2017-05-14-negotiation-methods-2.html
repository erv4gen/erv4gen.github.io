<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
<span style='color: #222222; font-family: "diaria light pro" , sans-serif;'><span style="font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I here at work needed the skill of work with clients and ability to conduct negotiations. Up to this point, I was focused only on the financial analysis and did not take into account another part of this business at all - negotiations and process of the conclusion of transactions.<br />
The last experience showed that ability to communicate with clients not less valuable, than the ability to find the prospective company for investment.<br />
As well as always, I solved approach it from studying at the base.<br />
To be advised to read the book "It is possible to agree about everything! How to try to obtain a maximum in any negotiations" the author Gavin Kennedy.<br />
