Today, I closed my first M &amp; A deal (Mergers and Acquisitions).<br />
Owning shares in Bashneft, I put up an offer for the sale of Rosneft's securities.<br />
The operation is quite simple, it is enough to apply through a broker:<br />

<br />
Here are details&nbsp;about&nbsp;my investing :<br />
<ul><br />
<li><span>Buy price: 3529</span></li>
<br />
<li><span>Offer price:&nbsp;3706,4&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
Total return is: 5,02%<br />
<br />
I think the first experience is quite successful, but for further work in this area, it will be necessary to closely study all the features of working with M &amp; A. For this I will look for relevant literature.</div>
