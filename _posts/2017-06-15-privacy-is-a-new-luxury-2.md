"Privacy is a new luxury" - It seems that quite so it is possible to characterize our century of information.<br />
I have come across one scandal with Sberbank and one fast-food restraint. Briefly: Sberbank has been charged with sale of the history of transactions of users in order of targeting advertising on the internet. Actually, it is Violation of Bank secrecy. And it is only one of a set of the cases recorded in recent years.At the same time, the companies even aren't protected, being covered with the "depersonalized" data and full "confidentiality."<br />
Recently I have attended the conference on BIG DATA organized by Beeline. The main agenda of this meeting was just monetization of the clients given to activity (the home Internet, television, geolocation, etc.).<br />
All this works by one principle: on the client the detailed statistics of the fact that he watches what sites he visits what purchases he makes In WHAT PLACES he is and AS it is FREQUENT collects. Further, these data are profiled and on sale to the advertising companies.<br />
As a result, we receive:<br />
I went to McDonald's - Receive advertising of the burger in the browser!<br />
You look series on TV much - Receive cashback at a subscription to ivi<br />
Sounds, it seems, harmlessly. And is further what? And also - algorithmization and the predictive analysis of your activity. Already now many recruiting agencies with results of Big data research. Ethics questions fade into the background here.<br />
Of course, there are both pluses and apparent benefits for society. Some will consider the interest that thanks to technologies the necessary goods will easier get to the most needing consumers.<br />
Personally my opinion such: while there is no big button "right to oblivion" - it is possible to be covered with "good intentions" as much as long.<br />
